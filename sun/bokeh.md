# Styling

you pass in other parameters for better styling
bokeh comes with a bunch of built-in palletes

from bokeh.models import Plot

plot = Plot()
plot.add_glyph()
plot.add_layout()
plot.add_tools()

Bokeh has some awesome templates / css to get started. Beware of using bokeh.min.css

At the core of Bokeh is the idea of "glyphs" which are shapes. (znote: add for stem renders)

You can pass in fonts as args
